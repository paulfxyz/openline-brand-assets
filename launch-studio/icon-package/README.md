# Openline mobile icon candidate · 2026-10-06

Canonical mark geometry preserved. Default visible mark width: 43.5% of square,
approximately 17.5% smaller linearly than the 52.7% candidate. White square unchanged.
44.8% and 42.2% alternatives represent approximately 15% and 20% reductions from 52.7%.
Original export: approximately 68%. No pre-rendered corners or shadows.

## iOS
Import ios/AppIcon.appiconset into Assets.xcassets for the standard PNG workflow.
Default icons are opaque RGB PNGs. The 1024px icon is included.
icon-composer-layers contains full-canvas background, black mark and orange accent
layers for manual assembly in Apple's Icon Composer. These are SOURCE LAYERS,
not a compiled .icon document. Validate default, dark, tinted and clear appearances
in current Xcode on-device. Appearance-reference PNGs are design references only.

## Android
Merge android/res into your application resources; do not overwrite app resources
blindly. Point android:icon to @mipmap/ic_launcher. Configure roundIcon as appropriate
for your app and test masks on real devices. v26 adaptive XML and v33 monochrome XML
are supplied. The adaptive candidate spans 39.6dp on a 108dp canvas, a 17.5%
reduction from the prior 48dp artwork. This is below Android's recommended
48–66dp range: it is an explicit smaller-size experiment, not a recommendation
to skip native legibility testing. The android/48dp-reference directory supplies
foreground and monochrome replacements at the prior guideline-aligned size.
Masked appearance differs from iOS; validate every mask on actual launchers.
The 43.5% flat composition applies to iOS, legacy Android and store-listing icons.
Google Play icon: 512x512 RGBA PNG, fully opaque. No rounded corners baked in.

## Release gate
These files are design candidates, not store approval. Verify rendering in the
signed release builds and approve the final size before replacing production icons.
