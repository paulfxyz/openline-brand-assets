CHOOSE WITH THE DETAILS IN FRONT OF YOU
Browse your destination, compare data allowances and duration, and review the price and activation conditions before you buy.

KEEP SETUP INFORMATION CLOSE
Find your eSIM's installation information and plan details in the app. Follow the instructions for your device and plan.

SEE YOUR PLANS IN ONE PLACE
Check the usage information shown for your plan and keep your travel eSIMs together. Availability and reporting can vary by plan.

NEW TO eSIM?
An eSIM is a digital SIM for a compatible device. Before purchasing, check that your phone supports eSIM and is network-unlocked.

BEFORE YOU GO
Review destination coverage, validity, activation timing and included services. Do not assume a data plan includes a phone number, calls or SMS. If you keep your usual line active, your home carrier's charges may still apply.

Openline is free to download. Mobile data plans are purchased separately. Availability and service conditions vary by destination and provider.

Visit openline.com for support information.`,
    reviewNotes:`Openline provides travel eSIM connectivity.

Before submission, the release owner must enter a working, non-expiring review account through App Store Connect's secure review fields. Do not put credentials in this workspace.

Explain: supported eSIM devices; provisioning and installation flow; any geography or hardware constraints; how a reviewer can access all functionality without a real purchase or an OTP dependency.

Describe the exact connectivity product and payment model, and confirm the applicable store payment policy. The screenshots must match this submitted build.

Provide tested steps for account deletion, support access, purchases and installation. Replace this preparation note with the verified build-specific instructions.`
